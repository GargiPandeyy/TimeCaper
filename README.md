# TimeCaper

A time travel adventure game where you play as an agent tasked with fixing timeline fractures by locating anachronisms across different historical eras.

I made it with html, css and js. It was very hard to make this project. I had to learn a lot of things asked to my teachers, friends, google and even used some ai. 

The hardest parts were figuring out the coordinate math for scanner detection—I had to learn `getBoundingClientRect()` and calculate distances using the Pythagorean theorem,
which was confusing because I kept mixing up coordinate systems. The Web Audio API was also tricky—creating oscillators and gain nodes to generate sound effects programmatically instead of using audio files.

Managing game state without a framework was tough, especially tracking completed missions, screen navigation, and saving progress to localStorage. 

The parallax background animations with multiple CSS keyframe layers moving at different speeds took forever to coordinate properly. 

Overall, I learned a lot about vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation, coordinate systems, and building complex interactions from scratch.

It was very time consuming but i like this now!
